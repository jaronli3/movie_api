They forwarded the telegram from Milwaukee - the one that came from Washington to say that Eddie wasn't coming at all. That Eddie was dead... ... so I figured I'd stay in San Francisco. i was alone but couldn't go back without Eddie. I found a job. And his insurance helped... and there were theaters in San Francisco.
